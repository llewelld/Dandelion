Quick instructions
******************

Under Linux

1. Install dependencies. This'll depend on your system, but for me on Ubuntu it requires the following:

sudo apt-get install autoconf
sudo apt-get install libgtkglext1-dev
sudo apt-get install glee-dev
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
sudo apt-get install libgnet-dev
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev

2. Generate configure scripts:

autoreconf --install

3. Generate makefiles:

./configure

4. Build application:

make

5. Install application (usually has to be done as root):

sudo make install

6. Run the Dandelion or client application:

./dandelion

or

./dandeclient

7. To create the debian package:

debuild -b --lintian-opts -X changes-file

8. To create the source archive:

make dist-zip

Under Windows

1. Build the application from the console:

windows\build.bat

2. Run the application by double clicking the exe.

3. Create the installer and bootstrapper using WiX 3.7 (where <version> is something like 1.0.0):

windows\buildSetup.bat <version>


Windows Build Environment Installation
**************************************

Notes for how to set up a development environment for building Dandelion on Windows.

1. Install GTK2+ development libraries
	Run the installer: gtk-dev-2.12.9-win32-1.exe
	
2. Check the following paths have been added to the environment variables (add them if not)
	GTK_BASEPATH contains: C:\GTK
	INCLUDE contains:
		C:\GTK\INCLUDE
		C:\GTK\INCLUDE\GTK-2.0
		etc...
	Path contains: %GTK_BASEPATH%\bin
	LIB contains: C:\GTK\LIB

3. Install MinGW
Run the installer: MinGW-5.1.3.exe
(minimal is okay)

4. Check the following paths have been added to the environment variables (add them if not)
	Path contains: C:\MinGW\bin
	LIB contains: C:\MinGW\lib
	Include contains: C:\MinGW\include

5. Check that gcc is available from the command line
	type: gcc -v
	output: "gcc version 3.4.2 (mingw-special)"

6. Install gnet
	Copy gnet from gnet.zip into C:\GTK

7. Install Windows Installer XML Toolkit (v3.7 or later needed)

8. Build dandelion.exe, dandeclient.exe and the Dandelion Windows installer packages
	Open a command window inside the Dandelion folder.
	Execute: windows\build.bat
	Execute: windows\buildclient.bat
	Execute: windows\buildSetup.bat
